A Jupyter notebook outlining our calibration procedures for micropipette force sensors, using both the droplet evaporation (single pipette) and two-pipette methods from [‚Å†this Nature protocols paper.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-018-0110-x)

the repo also includes ImageJ macros (.ijm files) for quickly extracting pipette deflections or droplet dimensions for these calibrations. The deflection files are set up for the BSI express camera (on our Maryam microscope) at 4x magnification, and for our ximea camera at 1x magnification, but could be easily altered for any camera/mag.
